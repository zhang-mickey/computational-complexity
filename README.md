# NTM
A nondeterministic Turing machine is like a deterministic Turing machines but with two transition functions. 

# Class NTIME 
NTIME(t(n)) is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine inin c.t(n) time , where t(n) is a function of the input size n, c is a constant . 

# Diagonalization
Diagonalization refers to a class of techniques used in complexity theory to separate complexity classes.
