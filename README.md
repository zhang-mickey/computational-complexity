# NTM
A nondeterministic Turing machine is like a deterministic Turing machines but with two transition functions. 

# Class NTIME 
NTIME(t(n)) is the set of all decision problems that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine inin c.t(n) time , where t(n) is a function of the input size n, c is a constant . 

# Diagonalization
Diagonalization refers to a class of techniques used in complexity theory to separate complexity classes.

# cook
All NP-hardness results ultimately derive from the Cook-Levin theorem

# PCP
The PCP Theorem implies that for many NP optimization problems, computing near-optimal solutions is no easier than computing exact solutions.
By showing that even computing approximate solutions to many of these problems is NP-hard, the PCP Theorem extends the practical importance of the theory of NP-completeness
